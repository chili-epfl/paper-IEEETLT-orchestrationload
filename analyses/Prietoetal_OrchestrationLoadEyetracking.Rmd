abstract: "Orchestration load (the effort a teacher spends in coordinating the multiple activities and learning processes in an educational setting) has been proposed as a helpful construct in designing educational technologies that not only support learning, but also are usable at the classroom level. Until now, this notion has remained fuzzy, used solely on a high-level and abstract way. In order to ground orchestration load in empirical evidence and study it in a more systematic and detailed manner, we propose a model of factors that affect such load, and a measure for momen-to-moment orchestration load based on physiological data (concretely, mobile eye-tracking), along with other behavioral measures. This document presents the main analytic code and results of applying this method to four exploratory case studies, where teachers orchestrated technology-enhanced face-to-face lessons with primary school and university students. The data from these studies provides a first validation of this method in different conditions, and illustrate how it can be used to understand the effect of different classroom factors on the orchestration load of a teacher, and to extract evidence-based insights about classroom orchestration with technology."
