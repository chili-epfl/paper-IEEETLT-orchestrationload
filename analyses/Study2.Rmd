(add some contextual info from the paper)

As a first step, we download the dataset..., and preprocess it. The preprocessing again consists on aggregating the four load-related eyetracking metrics into 10-second episodes, using a rolling window with 5-second slide between windows. Then, that aggregated data is merged with the video codes generated by researchers, regarding the social level, teacher activity and gaze focus (during the 10-second episodes where all eyetracking metrics agreed on high/low values). 

Aside from those variables in Study 1, we have another "assumed ground truth" variable, which associates the Expert teacher sessions with lower loads and the Novice teacher sessions with high loads.
